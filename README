INSTALL has installation instructions.  The man page explains usage.

README.md is a web friendly summary of both of the above.

README.caps explains how to setup POSIX 1003.1e capabilities.  Without
working capabilities, cage is equivalent to the vanilla chroot(8) command.

The Attic directory contains some debugging tools and a patch for init(8).

The poc directory contains some sample code showing methods of breaking
chroot.  Any contributions will be welcome.

Any bugs found should be reported via github issues at https://github.com/anthonyu/cage/issues

Enjoy,
Anthony
